It uses transactional datasets to determine which products are frequently purchased together. Retailers can use the recommendations to inform personalized cross-selling and upselling, helping increase conversion and maximizing the value of each customer.**"

An Amazon.com product page will usually have a section called “Customers who bought this item also bought,” presenting you with a list of items that are frequently bought together with the product you are currently browsing. That list is generated via market basket analysis. Market basket analysis is also used by brick-and-mortar retailers for store optimization by informing product placements and adjacencies in planograms. The idea is to drive more sales by placing complementary items next to each other.**"

    "**Market basket analysis uses association rules learning to make recommendations. Association rules look for relationships between items using large transactional datasets.xiv Association rules are calculated from two or more items called itemsets. An association rule consists of an antecedent (if) and a consequent (then). For example, if someone buys cookies (antecedent), then the person is also more likely to buy milk (consequent). Popular association rule algorithms include Apriori, SETM, ECLAT, and FP-Growth. Spark MLlib includes a highly scalable implementation of FP-Growth for association rule mining.xv FP-Growth identifies frequent items and calculates item frequencies using a frequent pattern (“FP” stands for frequent pattern) tree structure.xvi**"
