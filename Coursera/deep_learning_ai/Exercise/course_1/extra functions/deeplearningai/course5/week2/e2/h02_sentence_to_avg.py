    """
    Converts a sentence (string) into a list of words (strings). Extracts the GloVe representation of each word
    and averages its value into a single vector encoding the meaning of the sentence.

    Arguments:
    sentence -- string, one training example from X
    word_to_vec_map -- dictionary mapping every word in a vocabulary into its 50-dimensional vector representation

    Returns:
    avg -- average vector encoding information about the sentence, numpy-array of shape (50,)
