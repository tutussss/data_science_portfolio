"""
In deep learning, you deal with very large datasets. Hence, a non-computationally-optimal function can become a huge
bottleneck in your algorithm and can result in a model that takes ages to run. To make sure that your code is
computationally efficient, you will use vectorization. For example, try to tell the difference between the following
implementations of the dot/outer/elementwise product.
