      <p>Quick table calculations allow for quick implementation of common transformations, with the default setting. In this case, we implemented the <span class="packt_screen">Percent Difference</span> calculation. By default, it sets the difference to be relative to the previous data point (<span class="packt_screen">Year</span>). Then, we edited the default settings a bit by changing the calculation to be relative to the first data point in the view, not the previous one. Because of that, all of the percentages in our view are set to be relative to the year 1990. However, it is important to note that table calculations only take into account the data that is in the view. So, for example, if we filtered the year 1990 out from our view, all our calculations would then be relative to the year 1991, which would become the first data point in the view.</p>
