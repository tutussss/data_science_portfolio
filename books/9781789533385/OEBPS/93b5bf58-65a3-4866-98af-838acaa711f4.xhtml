      <div class="mce-root packt_quote CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Thank you to my beautiful wife<em>,</em> Svetlana, who supports me during my professional journey and always has a positive attitude. In addition, I want to hug my kids, Vasily, Anna, and Michael and hope one day they will be proud of their dad who planted trees in the backyard and wrote a couple of books. PS for sure, we will go on vacation soon and have some fun together!<br/>
