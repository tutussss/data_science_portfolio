      <p>We have extrapolated the closing prices of the company's shares based on the prices we have recorded in our dataset. Let's explore the characteristics of the model we have created, by inspecting the content of the <span class="packt_screen">Describe Forecast</span> window.</p>

      <p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Summary</span> tab, we can see some basic information describing our forecast. The most important of these is quality—it describes how well the forecast fits our actual data and can take values of <kbd>Good</kbd>, <kbd>Ok</kbd>, and <kbd>Poor</kbd>.</p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>In the <span class="packt_screen">Models</span> tab, we can see the role of the <span class="packt_screen">Level</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Trend</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Season</span> components of our model. We can also see the quality metrics that provide information about the statistical quality of our model—<strong>root mean squared error</strong><span> </span>(<strong>RMSE</strong>), <strong>mean absolute error </strong>(<strong>MAE</strong>), <strong>mean absolute percentage error</strong> (<strong>MAPE</strong>), and <strong>Aikake Information Criterion</strong> (<strong>AIC</strong>). Finally, in the <span class="packt_screen">Models</span> tab, we can get the information about smoothing coefficients that were used to weight the data points according to their how recent they are, so that forecast errors are minimized as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

      </p>

      <p>Tableau allows us to choose the time period for which we wish to predict the values. We have chosen 5 quarters, but we can increase the period further. However, note that the precision of our prediction becomes smaller as our forecasting length period becomes longer. This is reflected by the prediction interval (the shaded area around the line), which becomes larger as we make our prediction period becomes longer.</p>
