      <p>Classification of cases in groups is one of the most important tasks in data mining and analytics. In the previous recipe, <q>Clustering</q>, we made clusters of similar cases based on measures by letting Tableau discover groups and patterns in the data. However, there are also situations where we already have a dimension labeling certain groups in our data, and we want to create a model that will predict group membership using other fields in our dataset. For this task, we can use a tree-based model. By the end of this chapter, you'll have built a decision tree using a classification algorithm, while retaining a focus on a real-life business question.</p>
