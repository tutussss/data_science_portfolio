      <p>Although Tableau is very versatile even when just it's basic features are used, it is the wide range of advanced functionalities that make it very powerful. This chapter will gently introduce you to more advanced Tableau features. Through easy-to-understand, step-by-step recipes, you will get comfortable with calculated fields, quick table calculations, groups and sets, parameters, and level of detail expressions. To become a true Tableau master, you are encouraged to keep expanding your knowledge and practicing those concepts beyond this chapter. In the first six recipes, we will be dealing with the topics of table calculations and calculated fields, groups and sets, parameters, and LOD expressions, and we will use the <span><kbd>Unemployment_rates_1990-2016.csv</kbd> dataset, provided by United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The dataset contains data on the size of the civilian labor forceâ€”the number of employed and unemployed people by metropolitan statistical area of the United States, between 1990 and 2016.</span></p>

      <p class="mce-root">Also, after becoming familiar with maps in <a href="2bc384b5-8626-4a3d-bc4a-5b8a0cdd9c74.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Tableau Software</em>, you will also learn how to take Tableau geospatial analytics a step further and use custom geocoding and polygon maps. In the last two recipes covering geospatial analytics, we will be using the <span><kbd>Province_geocoding.csv</kbd>, <kbd>Serbian_provinces_population_size.csv</kbd>, <kbd>Serbia_Provinces_Features.csv</kbd></span>, <span>and <kbd>Serbia_Provinces_Points.csv</kbd> datasets. These datasets contain different combinations of geocoding data (longitude and latitude) of Serbian provincial centers and borders, as well as data on their population sizes. </span>Let's dive in!</p>
