      <p>We have chosen to filter our view by the number of <span class="packt_screen">Points</span>. We have turned on filter control so that we can select the range of <span class="packt_screen">Points</span> we want to include in the view. When we change the number of <span class="packt_screen">Points</span>, countries that are displayed stay the same, but the color changes. That's because different rows get included in the view.</p>

      <p>For example, when we set the range of <span class="packt_screen">Points</span> to 85-90, the <span class="packt_screen">Price</span> is only calculated on the rows that satisfy the condition specified by the filter<span>â€”</span>that is, where <span class="packt_screen">Points</span> are between 85 and 90. So, the average price that is presented in the changes as different rows are being excluded and included in the view by the filter.</p>
