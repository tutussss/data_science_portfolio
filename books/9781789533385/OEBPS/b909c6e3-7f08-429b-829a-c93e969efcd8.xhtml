      <p>In this recipe, we created a visualization where difference from the overall average of employment is calculated, but in such a way that the overall average is used as a reference point regardless of what is included in the visualization. So, when we include <span class="packt_screen">Year</span>, our visualization shows the average difference in <span class="packt_screen">Employment</span> per year (when we say average, we mean average across all the rows in the data source that belong to the particular year) from the overall average of <span class="packt_screen">Employment</span>.</p>

      <p>If we, for example, included <span class="packt_screen">Month</span> in our visualization as well, the average difference would be computed <span>for each month of each year</span>, but would still be calculated relative to the overall average of <span class="packt_screen">Employment</span>. That's because we told Tableau to keep the overall average fixed, regardless of what is in our visualization.</p>
