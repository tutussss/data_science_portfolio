      <p>Cluster analysis works by grouping cases (in our example, car models) into clusters based on a complex underlying pattern of scores on multiple measures. When setting up the cluster analysis, we entered all of the measures we wanted the cluster based on into the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Clusters</span><span> </span>window, and Tableau automatically detected the optimal number of clusters. There are many clustering algorithmsâ€”the one implemented in Tableau is called k-means.</p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>But this is just the beginning of the analysis. The next step is to interpret the clusters. We can use the <span class="packt_screen">Describe Clusters</span><span> </span>function to aid the interpretation. We'll access it by right-clicking on the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Clusters</span><span> </span>pill in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Marks</span><span> </span>card and selecting<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Describe Clusters</span><span> </span>from the drop-down menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

      </p>

      <p>This will launch the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Describe Clusters</span><span> </span>window. Under<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Summary</span>, we can see what variables entered into the cluster analysis, as well as<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Summary Diagnostics</span>, which includes the description of the model itself, as well as that of the individual clusters. The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Summary</span><span> </span>tab is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2026 image-border" src="images/40531da2-360d-4b32-aeee-a0f40dbf8c5a.png" style="width:36.58em;height:37.50em;" />

      </p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>If we navigate to the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Models</span><span> </span>tab, we'll see the results of<span> </span>the <span class="packt_screen">Analysis<span> </span>of Variance,</span> showing us which variables actually differentiate the clusters. The<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Models</span> tab is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2027 image-border" src="images/8f42a854-04fc-45f9-9fe4-b59c50164db4.png" style="width:44.67em;height:31.67em;" />

      </p>

      <p>In<span> </span><span>in the preceding screenshot</span>, we can see that all of the variables, except for<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Sum of Vs</span><span> </span>and<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Sum of Gear</span>, are significant by looking at their associated values in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">p-value</span><span> </span>column. A<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">p-value</span> that is less than or equal to 0.05 is usually considered significant. To gain more insight into how these variables differentiate the clusters, we can compare the values of different variables for each of the clusters in the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Summary</span><span> </span>tab, under<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Summary Diagnostics</span>. We can also create new scatterplots by placing various measures into the<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Rows</span><span> </span>and<span> </span><span class="packt_screen">Columns</span><span> </span>shelves, so we can gain a better sense of how the clusters are distributed.</p>
