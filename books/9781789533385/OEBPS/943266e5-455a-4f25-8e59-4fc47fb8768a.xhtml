      <p class="mce-root"><span>In this recipe, we have created a model, and we can now save it and apply it to another dataset (for detailed explanation and instructions, see the recipe</span> <q>Forecasting based on multiple regression</q><span>). You might also want to try further evaluation the model by splitting the data into a training and a test set. It is a common practice in data modeling to use a part of the data set as the training set, on which the model is built (fitted). The model is then evaluated on the test set. If the fit that is observed for the training set is preserved in the test set, it is an indication that we did a good job. Otherwise, we need to reconsider our model.</span></p>
