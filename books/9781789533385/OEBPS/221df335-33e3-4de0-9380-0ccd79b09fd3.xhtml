      <p>Calculated fields, especially when complex, can also give Tableau <span>a hard time</span>. However, you can counter this by trying to implement the following:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>If there's a calculation metric that's frequently used in your workbook, consider creating it directly in the database, and not as a table calculation. This can save computational resources Tableau would otherwise have to invest in creating the views.</li>

        <li>Disaggregated (row-level) calculations can be very demanding. Try to aggregate your measures when creating calculated fields.</li>

      </ol>

      <ol start="3">

        <li>When alternatives are available, consider using functions that are faster to execute in your calculated fields. For example:</li>

      </ol>

      <ul>

        <li>Try replacing IF-ELSE statements with CASE-WHEN statements</li>

        <li>Try to avoid nested IF statements</li>

        <li>Try to skip using LOD expressions if not necessary, since they can be computationally demanding</li>

      </ul>
