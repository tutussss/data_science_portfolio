      <p><span>In this recipe, we compared the age groups and then focused only on those who currently do not recycle. We can see that among 15-24 year olds, we have the smallest percentage (28%) of those who know about the possibility of recycling but do not use it. Based on that, we can conclude that within the 15-24 age group, we have the smallest percentage of buyers who are resistant to our promotional efforts. Accordingly, we can assume that we have a good potential for recycling within this group! Now, we have all the elements. In the following sections, we will learn how to connect them in a story.</span></p>
