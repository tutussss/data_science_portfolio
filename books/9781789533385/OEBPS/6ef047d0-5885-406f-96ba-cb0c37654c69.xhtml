      <p>In this recipe, we learned how to detect outliers. Outliers are extreme values that stand out from the other values in the sample. In order to detect outliers, we relied on a commonly used conventional ruleâ€”outliers are all values that deviate from the mean more than +/-2.5 standard deviations, which excludes around 1% of our sample.</p>

      <p>In this example, we are able to see how outliers can influence statistical models. We can see that the model that includes outliers has a much steeper slope than the model that excludes outliers, meaning that they have pulled<strong> </strong>our linear model away from the majority of data, giving us skewed results. When interpreting results, we have to pay special attention to this (so-called leverage) effect. Otherwise, we risk declaring a statistical effect significant even when it does not actually exist.   </p>
