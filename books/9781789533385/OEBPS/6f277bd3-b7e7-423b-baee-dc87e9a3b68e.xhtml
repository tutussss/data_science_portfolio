      <p>We have discovered that the level of awareness of recycling possibilities is much higher among those who regularly read labels on food packaging.</p>

      <p>Letâ€™s consolidate what we have found up to this point. We learned that men and women do not differ in their awareness about recycling significantly. We know that among the 15-24 age group of milk buyers, we have the highest percentage of those who are not aware that the milk carton can be recycled in Serbia. We also know that the level of awareness is lower among those who do not regularly read labels on packaging. </p>
