      <p>What we performed is an <span class="packt_screen">Inner</span> join of the two tables. There are also other joins, such as <span class="packt_screen">Left</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Right</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Full Outer</span>, offered in Tableau. They're generally available to switch between, in the <span class="packt_screen">Join</span> window.    </p>

      <p>Using an inner join was appropriate in our case, because all of the rows in both tables could be matched—thanks to a unique key field. The inner joins produce tables with cases that have been matched in both tables.</p>

      <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Left</span> join keeps all of the values from the left tables, while using only the cases from the right table that have a match in the left table, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

      </p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>The <span class="packt_screen">Right</span> join works on the same principle, but keeping all of the values from the right table, <span>as shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>

      </p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>Finally, a <span class="packt_screen">Full Outer</span> join keeps all of the cases from both tables, regardless of whether they have a match in the other table or not. Null values will be placed in cases where a match isn't found:</p>

      </p>

      <p>As of the 2018.2<span> release</span>, Tableau also offers another kind of joins—<span class="packt_screen">Spatial</span> joins. They allow you to join points and polygons from spatial tables on the basis of their location. This is achieved through a new joining predicate known as <strong>intersect</strong>, which matches the location of points from one table to polygons in another table, joining data when a point lies within a polygon.</p>
