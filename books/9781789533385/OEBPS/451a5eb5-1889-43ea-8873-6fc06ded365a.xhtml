      <p>Once we make the basic narrative, we need to pick up the crucial moments to present in a Story. When we were speaking about the development phase of storytelling, we said that we should inform our listener about the hypothesis that we tested. However, this does not mean that we need to describe every step that we made <span>in detail and </span>every dead end that we encountered. Like a movie director who cuts the frames of scenes when editing a movie, we also need to crop only those elements that are important for our Story. All the other things should be mentioned, but in a way that they do not draw attention away from the main plot of the Story. </p>
