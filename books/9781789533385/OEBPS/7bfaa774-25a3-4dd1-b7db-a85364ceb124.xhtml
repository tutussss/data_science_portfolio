      <p>In <a href="2bc384b5-8626-4a3d-bc4a-5b8a0cdd9c74.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Tableau</em>, we encountered filters and learned how to implement basic ones. Filters allow us to use just part of the rows in a dataset, and this basic principle is common to all the filters we will be working with.</p>

      <p>However, Tableau's filtering capabilities extend far beyond the basic filtering you have learned so far. In this chapter, you will become comfortable with implementing top N filters, measure filters, different kinds of date filters, table calculation filters, and action filters.</p>

      <p>In this chapter, we will mostly be using the <kbd>Winery.csv</kbd> dataset, originally found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle.com</a>. It contains data on winesâ€”which winery they belong to, which province they originate from, number of points, price of the wine, and the name of the wine taster who rated them, among other details.</p>

      <p>In the two recipes dealing with date filters, <em>Creating date range filters</em> and <em>Creating relative date filters,</em> we will be using the <kbd>Bread_basket.csv</kbd> dataset, which contains transactions from a bakery with their dates. This dataset was also originally found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle.com</a>.</p>
