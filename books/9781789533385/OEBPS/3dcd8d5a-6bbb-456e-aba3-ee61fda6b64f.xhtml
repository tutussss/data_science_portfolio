      <p>Correspondence analysis works similarly to PCA, which we covered in the first recipe, Discovering latent structure of the dataset, of this chapter. It reduces the number of dimensions that differentiate our cases (in this example, brands) so we have a clearer overview of how each of the brands is positioned. On the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes, we plotted the first two dimensions extracted by correspondence analysis, which have the same function as the first two principal components in the principal components analysis.</p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>Both the brands and the attributes describing them are plotted in the space created by the first two dimensions. We interpret the results, or read the map, by looking at the spatial relationship of attributes and brands. In our example, we see that <span class="packt_screen">Brand.B</span> is perceived as <span class="packt_screen">High-Tech</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Innovative</span>, offering <span class="packt_screen">Fast Internet</span> and a good choice of smartphones. On the other hand, it's on the opposite side of the spectrum from the attributes <span class="packt_screen">Affordable</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Values Loyal Customers</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Clear offer</span>, which are more representative of <span class="packt_screen">Brand.A</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Brand.C</span>. Additionally, <span class="packt_screen">Brand.A</span> is also seen as <span class="packt_screen">Trustworthy</span> and having professional staff, while <span class="packt_screen">Brand.C</span> has an image of a <span class="packt_screen">Youthful</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Fair</span> brand that is a strong market influencer. Overall, the map helps us form a well-rounded image of how customers perceive each of the brands.</p>
