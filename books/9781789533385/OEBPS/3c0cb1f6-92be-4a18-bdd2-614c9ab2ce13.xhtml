      <p>We created a calculated field that contains the difference between the current and the previous data point. We used the <kbd>LOOKUP</kbd> function to return the aggregated value of <kbd>Civilian Labor Force</kbd> for the previous data point, and then subtracted it from the aggregated value of <kbd>Civilian Labor Force</kbd> in the current data point. This resulted in a new field that contains this difference, and which we can now use in our visualizations. <span>Keep in mind that all table calculation functions, including the <kbd>LOOKUP</kbd> function, require an aggregated value to work with. That means that, when we use fields without an aggregation function – for example, just <kbd>Civilian Labor Force</kbd> instead of <kbd>SUM([Civilian Labor Force])</kbd></span>—<span>we may get an error in the calculated field.</span></p>

      <p>However, it is important to note that our original dataset has remained unchanged—the calculated field we created has not been written to it and, if we were to open a new Tableau workbook and connect to the <kbd>Unemployment_rates_1990-2016.csv</kbd> dataset, we would not find our calculated field among the fields in the data source.</p>
