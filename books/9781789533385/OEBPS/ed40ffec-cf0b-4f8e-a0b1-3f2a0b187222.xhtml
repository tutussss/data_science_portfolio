      <p>After having developed your <span>model</span>, you can save it as the <kbd>.rda</kbd> file at your computer and reuse it with a new dataset. Let's say you receive some more data about consumers, and you want to see how many of them you can expect to go for a new carâ€”you can just feed that data into the model you've already developed and get an estimate. For more details on how to do this, you can refer to the <em>Forecasting based on multiple regression</em> recipe in <a href="e790e62f-02a6-4e5a-a988-40f64f0cb60f.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Forecasting with Tableau</em>.</p>
