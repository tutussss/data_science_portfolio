      <p>Snowflake is the leading cloud data warehouse platform. Moreover, it is the first data warehouse that was created for the cloud. In this section, we will launch a Snowflake instance and connect to it with Tableau. Currently, Snowflake is available for AWS and Azure. We are going to use the AWS version of Snowflake.</p>

      <p>Snowflake has a multi-cluster shared architecture, and it separates storage and computes. This allows it to <span>easily</span> scale up and down on the fly without any disruption.</p>

      <p>Snowflake is an SQL data warehouse that supports structured and semi-structured data, such as JSON, AVRO, or XML.</p>

      <p>The Snowflake architecture consists of the following three layers:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><strong>Cloud services</strong>: This is a collection of services such as authentication, and so on</li>

        <li><strong>Query processing</strong>: Snowflake executes queries using a virtual warehouse, for example, an MPP cluster with multiple compute nodes using Amazon EC2 or Azure virtual machines</li>

        <li><strong>Database storage</strong>: Snowflake stores optimized data in Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>Let's take a look at the following diagram that depicts the preceding mentioned layers:</p>

      </p>

      <p>There is the same principle when we allow Snowflake to do the heavy lifting and then, Tableau renders the results. As a result, we don't need to use Tableau extracts.</p>

      <p>With a live connection, we should avoid a custom SQL data source because often it is counterproductive, and could be run multiple times on the dashboard. Tableau itself can generate much more efficient queries.</p>
