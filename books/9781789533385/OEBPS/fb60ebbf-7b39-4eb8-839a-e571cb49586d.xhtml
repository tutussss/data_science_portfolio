      <p>Tableau has correctly recognized that the <span class="packt_screen">State</span> dimension contains geographical information, and has assigned a geographical role to it. This is indicated by a small globe symbol (<img src="images/77f2601b-a4d9-4364-8561-bd8ae96fd00c.png" />) next to the dimension name in the <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> pane, as well as in the data preview on the <span class="packt_screen">Data Source</span> page. Based on that, it has automatically generated two new measures, which are not in the dataset itself: <span class="packt_screen">Longitude</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Latitude</span>. When you drag and drop the <span class="packt_screen">State</span> dimension into the worksheet workspace, the <span class="packt_screen">Show Me</span> functionality is implemented. It places <span class="packt_screen">State</span> in <span class="packt_screen">Detail</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> card, <span class="packt_screen">Longitude</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> shelf, and <span class="packt_screen">Latitude</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> shelf. Based on what we do with our measure, <span class="packt_screen">Frequency</span>, Tableau automatically chooses the appropriate mark type, which is a circle or a map.</p>
