      <p>Table calculations only take into account data that is in the view. We have created a table calculation to show the proportion of records by each wine taster. However, when we exclude all wine taster names but one, Tableau recalculates the table calculation using only data that is in the view, which means that all records in each country now belong to a single <span class="packt_screen">Taster Name</span>.</p>

      <p>This results in a completely uninformative view, which tells us that 100% of records belong to this particular taster.</p>

      <p>By implementing the table calculation filter, we allow the original table calculation (that computes the percentages) to take place before the view is actually filtered, and not the other way around, which is the case when we just implement the filter by <span class="packt_screen">Wine Taster</span>.</p>

      <p>Because of this, our view is filtered after the table calculation is performed, and the table calculation is unaffected by some of the rows being filtered out of the view.</p>
