      <p>In this recipe, we have created a set based on a condition: the value of <span class="packt_screen">Employment</span>. We have set the condition so that all the data points that have the value of <span class="packt_screen">Employment</span> equal to or higher than <span class="packt_screen">297027</span> (which is the average value of <span class="packt_screen">Employment</span> across the entire dataset) are included in the set, and all the other data points are excluded from it. This created a new fieldâ€”our set, which we then used in the visualization. The set field now works as a discrete dimension with two values: <span class="packt_screen">In</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Out</span> that denote the data points that are in/out of the set. We used these values in our visualization to color the year with average or above average employment.</p>

      <div class="packt_tip">If you want the set members to appear in your visualization, right-click on the <span class="packt_screen">Set</span> pill that you have included in your view, and in the drop-down menu switch from <span class="packt_screen">S</span><span class="packt_screen">how In</span><span class="packt_screen">/</span><span class="packt_screen">Out of Set</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Show Members in Set</span>.</div>
