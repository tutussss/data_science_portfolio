      <p>In the preview on the <span class="packt_screen">Data Source</span> page, we see that the format of the data has changed. The original column names—<span class="packt_screen">Belgrade</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Central Serbia</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Vojvodina—</span>have now become labels in a new column—<span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Names</span>.</p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>On the other hand, the values from the three original columns have all been merged into one new column—<span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Values</span>:</p>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

      </p>

      <p>What happened is that we've simply transposed the table, so that we have values from all three columns placed into one column (one beneath the other), while the labels in the <span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Names</span> column denote the original column each value (row) originates from.</p>

      <p>If we navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 1,</span> we'll see that we now have <span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Names</span> as a dimension, and <span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Values</span> as a measure. For ease of use, we can rename them into something more intuitive. We can do this by right-clicking on the field and selecting <span class="packt_screen">Rename</span> from the drop-down menu. We can then type in the desired name. For example, we can rename <span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Names</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Region</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Pivot Field Values</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Satisfaction</span> <span class="packt_screen">with internet</span>:</p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      </p>

      <p>This new structure of the data source is much handier than the original one, because it allows us to make visualizations containing all three regions. Let's see how:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Region</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Columns</span> shelf.</li>

      </ol>

      <p> </p>

      <ol start="2">

        <li>Drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Satisfaction with</span> internet from <span class="packt_screen">Measures</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> shelf:</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        <img src="images/feefdfae-ee48-4811-92a0-779ecda2d5ac.png" style="width:19.67em;height:51.33em;" />

      </p>

      <p>We've created a chart with a single measure and single dimensions that we'd previously created by pivoting our data source.</p>

      <div class="packt_tip">Keep in mind that other sheets using a data source might be affected by pivoting. If any of the original columns that're being pivoting have already been used in a view, they won't be available anymore after pivoting.</div>
