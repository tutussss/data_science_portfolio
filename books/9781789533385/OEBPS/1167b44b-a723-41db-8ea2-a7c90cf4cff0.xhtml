      <p>Filtering is, without a doubt, a fundamental feature of Tableau. However, in some cases, filters can have a negative effect on a workbook's performance. In order to keep your workbook running optimally, try to be mindful of the following things:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Avoid applying filters to long lists. Querying for each option in your list can be a demanding task for Tableau. In cases where this might be an issue, consider creating a calculated field to shorten the list or use parameters.</li>

        <li>Filtering date fields can also be a demanding task for Tableau because individual dates can amount to a lot of data points for Tableau to process. However, we often don't need to filter on the lowest level of date granularity. So, when filtering dates, always try to think about the actual level of granularity you need to filter on and go with the highest level that you can. If you can - filter out years; if not, ask yourself if it is sufficient to filter out quarters, and so on. If possible, avoid filtering on the lower levels, such as days or hours.</li>

        <li>When adding a date field to the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> shelf, you can choose the level of granularity you would like to use, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
