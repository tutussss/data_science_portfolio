      <p style="padding-left: 60px">As we can see in the preceding screenshot, among females there are more buyers who are aware of recycling possibilities. The difference is not so striking, but it provides us with some insight. However, we should continue digging.</p>

      <ol start="8">

        <li>Open a blank worksheet, drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Age</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Column</span> shelf.</li>

        <li>Drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Number of Records</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Measures</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> shelf.</li>

        <li>Drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Aware of recycling possibility</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Color</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> card.</li>

        <li>Hover over the <span class="packt_screen">Number of Records</span> pill in the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> shelf so that a small downward arrow appears and click on it.</li>

        <li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Quick Table Calculation</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Percent of Total</span>. Choose E<span class="packt_screen">dit Table Calculation...</span> and then select <span class="packt_screen">Table (down)</span>.</li>

        <li>Press <em>Ctrl</em> and drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Number of Records</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Label</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Marks</span> card.</li>

        <li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 5</span> tab at the bottom of the page and enter <kbd>Awareness by Age</kbd>:</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963 image-border" src="images/3367995a-0d7e-4d1c-86a5-7cc7435a4d9b.png" style="width:36.83em;height:31.58em;" />

      <p style="padding-left: 60px">Analyzing the results by age groups reveals some interesting differences in the level of awareness. Almost 75% of people aged 45 or older know that milk cartons can be recycled in Serbia. On the other hand, more than 60% buyers in the 15-24 age group do not know about this possibility. Based on that, we can conclude that the 15-24 group is the least informed and that we need to make a concerted effort to raise their awareness. That is our first clue. Let's investigate some more.</p>
