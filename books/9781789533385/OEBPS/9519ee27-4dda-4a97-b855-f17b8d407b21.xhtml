      <p>When splitting string fields, it's important to carefully inspect your data before and after splitting. As we saw in this example, it can easily happen that some instances don't follow the same format as the majority, and they won't be properly split.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, the splits we need to make are quite complex—the fields might not contain the same number of separators (as was the case our example) or they might contain different separators. More frequently than not, the dataset you're using will also be too large to manually correct the fields that aren't properly split. For those and similar cases, Tableau offers custom splits, as well as splitting the fields through regular expressions.</p>
