      <p>If you have trouble diagnosing the problem, you can always contact Tableau support. In order to help them understand what has happened, you might be asked to provide log files where the issue has been recorded. Naturally, you'll want to provide log files in the manner that's most useful and informative for the Tableau support team.</p>

      <p>If possible, you should create clean logs. But first, create a backup log. You can do this by following these steps:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Navigate to the folder where your logs are located.</li>

        <li>Rename the folder from <kbd>Logs</kbd> to <kbd>Logs_Backup</kbd>:</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

      </p>

      <ol start="3">

        <li>Create a new folder named <kbd>Logs</kbd>. <kbd>Logs </kbd><span>the new, clean folder where new logs will be stored, while the old folder,</span> <kbd>Logs_Backup</kbd><span>, won't be used anymore.</span></li>

      </ol>

      <p>Through the following steps, you will reproduce the issue that has occurred and send the logs to Tableau support:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Start Tableau and take the steps required to get to the point where the problem has occurred.</li>

        <li>Close all Tableau Desktop sessions, so that the errors are recorded to the log file.</li>

      </ol>

      <ol start="3">

        <li>Compress the <kbd>Logs</kbd> folder by right-clicking on it, selecting <span class="packt_screen">Send to</span>, and choosing <span class="packt_screen">Compressed (zipped) folder</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

      </ol>

      </p>

      <ol start="4">
