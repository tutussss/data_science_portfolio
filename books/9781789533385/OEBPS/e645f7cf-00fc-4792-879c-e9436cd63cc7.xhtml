      <p>In this recipe, we are going to learn how to deal with outliers. Outliers are data points that are very unusual, atypical, and deviate from the trend present in the majority of the dataset. Outliers can be dangerous if not dealt with appropriately because they can significantly skew the results of an analysis. In this recipe, we will explore ways of detecting outliers in Tableau. We are going to perform a regression analysis and see how the regression line is affected by these cases.</p>
