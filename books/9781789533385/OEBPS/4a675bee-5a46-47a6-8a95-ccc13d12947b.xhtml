      <p>The dataset that we're going to use for this recipe comes from a psychological survey. A group of people was assessed using a psychological test. The result of the assessment is psychological profile composed of numerical scores representing following personality traits: anxiety, hostility, self-consciousness, assertiveness, sensation seeking, positive emotions, aesthetics, ideas, values, fairness, altruism, gentleness, competency, achievement, and discipline.
