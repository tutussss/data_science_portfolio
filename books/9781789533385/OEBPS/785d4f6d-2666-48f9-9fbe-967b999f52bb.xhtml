      <p>Decision trees utilize the approach of repetitively dividing cases into smaller, more homogeneous groups. Finally, we end up with a classification tree which can be effectively visualized and easily interpreted. In our example, we're trying to answer the question based on the data we have. The question that arises is: can we effectively predict who's going to buy a new car and who's going to buy a used car? As it turns out, we can. We've created a predictive model using the previous R script, and we recorded the predicted values for each case in the new field called <span class="packt_screen">Prediction</span>. We've then created a visualization comparing the actual values of the <span class="packt_screen">Future Purchase</span> dimension and the values we predicted. We can clearly see that, although there are some misclassifications, our model performs pretty well!</p>
