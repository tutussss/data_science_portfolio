      <p>You might think of this flow as the logic for a couple of metrics. With Tableau Prep, you can build as many streams as you want, then union them and create the Tableau Extract. For example, we could add a branch in the middle of my flow and start to create new metrics with different grouping options, and then Union with my initial flow and write to the extract. This gives us performance benefits because our dashboards work faster without complex calculations and filters. Moreover, it visualizes the flow and allows end users to quickly understand the logic or apply the changes. There is a link with more information about Tableau Prep steps: <a href="https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/prep/en-us/prep_clean.htm">https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/prep/en-us/prep_clean.htm</a></p>
