      <p>Now, let's try another way of setting up filters. Before starting this recipe, undo the work you did in following the <em>Setting filters through the dashboard</em> recipe, so we start from scratch. We will now set the same filter, but through the worksheet. We will start from the dashboard without any filters applied:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 1</span> by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 1</span> tab at the bottom of the workspace.</li>

        <li>Drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">HH internet type</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> shelf.</li>

        <li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Filter</span> [<span class="packt_screen">HH internet type</span>] window, select <span class="packt_screen">All</span> and then click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>

        <li>Hover over the <span class="packt_screen">HH internet type</span> pill in the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> shelf so that a white arrow appears on the right.</li>

        <li>Click on the arrow and from the drop-down menu, select <span class="packt_screen">Show filter</span>:</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1352 image-border" src="images/eabe041d-f44f-4e19-aa7d-7f7192d51cff.png" style="width:18.67em;height:20.42em;" />

      </p>

      <ol start="6">

        <li>Hover over the <span class="packt_screen">HH internet type</span> card that has appeared and click on the small arrow in the top-right corner.</li>

        <li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Single Value (dropdown)</span>.</li>

        <li>Once again, hover over the <span class="packt_screen">HH internet type</span> pill in the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> shelf so that <span>a white arrow appears on the right, and click on it.</span></li>

        <li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Apply to Worksheets</span>, and from it, select <span class="packt_screen">Selected Worksheetsâ€¦</span>.</li>

        <li>Click <span class="packt_screen">All</span>, and then click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>

        <li>Navigate back to the dashboard by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard 1</span> card in the bottom of the workbook.</li>

        <li>If the filter you just added to <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 1</span> is not visible in the dashboard, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 1</span> chart and then click on the white-on-gray <span class="packt_screen">X</span> that appears along the outer border of the filter area:</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">

        <img src="images/2e70e70f-25a0-4579-b67b-6b0a9c66a0e6.png" />

      </p>

      <div class="packt_tip">The alternative method would be to click on the sheet in the dashboard, and navigate to<span> <span class="packt_screen">Filter</span> | <span class="packt_screen">HH internet type</span> from the drop-down menu.</span></div>

      <ol start="13">

        <li>After the chart has disappeared from the dashboard, drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Sheet 1</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Dashboard</span> pane into the dashboard view again, in the same spot, and the filter will appear in the dashboard.</li>

      </ol>

      <div style="color: black;font-size: 1em" class="packt_infobox">Adding filters through a worksheet works best before your worksheet has been added to the dashboard. If the filter card is visible before the worksheet is added to the dashboard, it will automatically appear in the dashboard as well when you add your worksheet to it.</div>
