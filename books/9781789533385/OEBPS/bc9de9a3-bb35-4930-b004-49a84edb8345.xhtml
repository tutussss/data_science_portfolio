      <p>Before doing any work in Tableau, we must first connect to the data we'll be working on. In the first recipe in this book, <em>Connecting to data</em>, we learned how to connect to a data source. In this chapter, we'll build on that knowledge to become more skillful at manipulating, joining, unioning, and transforming data sources. In the last recipe of this chapter, <em>Preparing data</em>, we'll also address the topic of data preparation and getting our data ready for visualizing and further analysis.</p>

      <p>In this chapter, we'll be using multiple datasets. In the first recipe, <em>Joining data sources</em>, we'll be using two datasets, <span><kbd>Public_Schools_1.csv</kbd> and <kbd>Public_Schools_2.csv</kbd>, which contain data on Boston public schools for the school year 2018/2019. The dataset originally comes from Kaggle's official site. In the</span> <em>Adding a secondary data source</em> and <em>Data blending</em> recipes, we'll use the <span><kbd>Internet_satisfaction.csv</kbd> and <kbd>Internet_usage.csv</kbd> datasets, which describe the results of a consumer survey on internet usage in Serbia, as well as data on internet penetration per region of the country. In the <em>Data union</em> recipe, we'll be using <kbd>Bread_basket_by_year.xlsx</kbd> (originally found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle.com</a>), which contains data about transactions in a bakery divided into two tables holding data for different years. In the</span> <em>Using Tableau Pivot </em><span>recipe</span>, we'll use <span><kbd>Internet_satisfaction_by_region.csv</kbd>, which holds some results of a customer satisfaction survey found in the <kbd>Internet_satisfaction.csv</kbd> file, but organized in a slightly different format. Finally, in the</span> <span><em>Preparing data</em> recipe, we'll use the <kbd>Winery.csv</kbd> dataset (originally found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle.com</a>), containing data on wines, their origin, pricing, and rating.</span></p>
