      <p>In this recipe, we created a scatter plot showing the multidimensional outliers. We did this because, sometimes, we can't simply isolate outliers on each dimension. Multivariate outliers are defined by their position on more than one variable, so it is important to observe them simultaneously. Certain cases don't have to be outliers on any one of the dimensions considered separately but are outliers if we observe their pattern of values on multiple dimensions.</p>

      <p class="mce-root"></p>

      <p>In our example, we've flagged two people with a respective blood pressure of 150 and 155 as outliers, circled in the following screenshot:</p>

      </p>

      <p>However, these values of <span class="packt_screen">Blood pressure</span> do not make them extreme—there are some subjects with much higher blood pressure. <span>With reference to the preceding screenshot, we can see that other subjects</span> who have blood pressure this high are also considerably older than the ones we marked—they are in their forties, or older, while our two flagged cases are in their early twenties! We can see that their peers have much lower blood pressure. So, while neither the values of <span class="packt_screen">Blood pressure</span> nor the values of <span class="packt_screen">Age</span> taken in isolation make this two cases extreme, when considered together, we see that these two subjects are unusual because they have unusually high blood pressure for their age. The opposite is true for other flagged cases—they are flagged because they have unusually low blood pressure for their (older) age. So, had we done a simple, one-dimensional, outlier analysis, we would have never detected these unusual cases.</p>
