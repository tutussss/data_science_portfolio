      <p>To keep our example clear and illustrative, we used a two-dimensional dataset (and two-dimensional outliers). However, you'll usually deal with datasets that have more than two dimensions. Nevertheless, the general approach you'll use to detect the multidimensional outliers will be the same. You can use the same syntax as the one we've used in this example, but simply add as many arguments as needed. The script will run in the same manner and detect the outliers.</p>

      <p>However, when operating with more than two dimensions, you won't be able to visualize the multidimensional outliers on a scatter plot as easily, since the pattern of values that makes them extreme is spread across various dimensions. If you wish to represent them visually, you can check out the <kbd>uniplot</kbd> function (<a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mvoutlier/versions/2.0.9/topics/uni.plot">https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mvoutlier/versions/2.0.9/topics/uni.plot</a>) from the <kbd>mvoutlier</kbd> package in R, which allows you to unfold the pattern of values into a series of unidimensional projections. Although it isn't as neat as Tableau visualizations, it'll provide some insight on how the outlier values can be interpreted. </p>
