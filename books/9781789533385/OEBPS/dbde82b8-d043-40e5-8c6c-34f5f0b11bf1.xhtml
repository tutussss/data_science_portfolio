      <p>Each worksheet in the dashboard can have its position tiled or floating. The tiled layout snaps elements into positions, so that they fit next to each other, while floating allows you to move elements around freely, even overlapping them. Strive to use the tiled layout when possible, and save floating for filters, legends, images, and other small elements that can overlap with worksheets to save space.</p>

      <div class="packt_tip">If you have floating elements in your dashboard, you should use the fixed display size! Otherwise, the tiled elements <span>will</span> resize with the screen size, while the floating elements will keep their position, leading to a messy look.</div>
