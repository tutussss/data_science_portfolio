      <pre style="padding-left: 60px" class="mce-root">Based on the results of our study, we can expect that promotional activities focused on the 15-24 age group can have a significant effect on their recycling habits. Because of that, our recommendation is to launch a promotional campaign that would be specifically designed in accordance with the media consumption habits of younger buyers. In this age group, we found that those who know about the possibility of recycling use it to a greater extent than the other groups. However, the awareness of the possibility of recycling milk cartons is lowest in this group. The current campaign was unsuccessful in raising awareness about recycling because it used a channel of communication that doesn’t reach young people. We can conclude that milk buyers within the 15-24 age group are responsive to the appeal to recycle, but we have to find a way to get the message across.</pre>
