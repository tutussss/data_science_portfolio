      <p>When working with relative date filters, Tableau allows a multitude of options. As well as specifying the number of days, we can also choose to show the selected number of years, quarters, months, or weeks relative to the selected date. Besides this, we can show not only a time period preceding the selected date, but also the one following it, by choosing <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> instead of <span class="packt_screen">Last</span>.</p>

      <p>Finally, besides setting a fixed date as we did in this recipe, we can also choose <span class="packt_screen">Today</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Yesterday</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Tomorrow</span> as the anchor dates, which is very useful when we want to have a view that is updated with fresh data relative to the current date.</p>
