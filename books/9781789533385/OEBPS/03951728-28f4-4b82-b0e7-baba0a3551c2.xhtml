      <p>In the climax phase, we are connecting the dots:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>The youngest purchasers are the least aware of the recycling possibility</li>

        <li>Those who do not regularly read labels on packaging are also not informed about the recycling possibility</li>

        <li>The youngest purchasers (the 15-24 group) do not regularly read labels (at least most of them)</li>

      </ul>

      <p>By linking these findings, we can arrive at a conclusion. The youngest purchasers are the least aware of the recycling possibility, mainly because they do not regularly read the labels on packaging.</p>

      <p>Here, we can point out the main difference between findings and insights. In a nutshell, a finding just informs us about the facts, while an insight provides an explanation of those facts. Findings give us the answer to the <em>what</em>, while insights answer the <em>why</em>. The crucial difference is that insights enable us to speculate about the underlying mechanism of a phenomenon, and put us in a position to make an impact on the situation and to change the facts. </p>
