      <p>We have successfully unioned the two tables. In the <span class="packt_screen">Data Source</span> page, they're now previewed as a single table, with two new columns that don't exist in either of the datasetsâ€”<span class="packt_screen">Sheet</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Table Name</span>. These two columns provide the metadata about the union, by denoting the source of the rows as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

      </p>

      <p>What actually happened is that the rows from both datasets were merged into one table. We can see that if we open a new blank worksheet and drag and drop <span class="packt_screen">Date</span> from <span class="packt_screen">Dimensions</span> into the <span class="packt_screen">Rows</span> shelf, the new unioned data source contains years coming from both datasets. Our union was successful because the tables had the same number of columns and the same column names. This allowed Tableau to match columns correctly.</p>
