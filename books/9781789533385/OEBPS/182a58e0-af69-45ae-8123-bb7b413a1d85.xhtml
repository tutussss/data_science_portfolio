      <p>We started from a view showing the top five wineries by the average price of their wines. Then, we added the filter by <span class="packt_screen">Province</span>, in order to see the top five wineries per province. However, the result we got was not what we wanted—when we selected the region of Burgundy, we got the winery that is in the top five wineries at the level of the total sample, which is also in the province of <span>Burgundy</span>.</p>

      <p>We achieved the output we desired when we added the <span><span class="packt_screen">Province</span> </span>filter to context—now, our view shows the top five wineries within each region. What changed when we added the <span><span class="packt_screen">Province</span> </span>filter to context?</p>

      <p>By adding the <span><span class="packt_screen">Province</span> </span>filter to context, we gave it priority over the top N filter. Context filters are filters that set the context in which other filters are applied. They take priority over the other filter(s) in the view, which are applied only on rows that have been filtered by the context filters.</p>
