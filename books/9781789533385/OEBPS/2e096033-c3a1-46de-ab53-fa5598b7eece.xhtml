      <p>By now, you have learned how to create individual tables and charts from your data. In this chapter, we will learn how to bring them all together in a dashboard. Dashboards are a powerful way to present visualizations that come from multiple worksheets, and even multiple data sources, in one view. We will learn how to create a dashboard, customize its visual style and layout, and implement advanced functionalities, such as actions and parameter filters. After completing the recipes in this chapter, we will be well equipped to start creating our own dashboards. </p>

      <p>We will be using two datasets that describe the results of a consumer survey, on internet use in Serbia, and we will view the satisfaction of users with various aspects of service from various internet providers. The <kbd>Internet_satisfaction.csv</kbd> dataset contains only internet users, and holds information on the regions of Serbia. It also tells us where they live; their main internet provider; what type of Internet is used in the household; and their satisfaction with the overall service, connection speed, and connection stability. The satisfaction was rated on a 5-point scale, where 1 means "completely dissatisfied" and 5 means "completely satisfied." The other dataset, <kbd>Internet_usage.csv</kbd>, contains information on household Internet penetration by region of Serbia, and settlement type (urban or rural). Notice that the field that holds information on region has the same values, but different names, across the two datasets.</p>
